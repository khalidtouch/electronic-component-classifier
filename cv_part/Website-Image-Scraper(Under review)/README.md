    - **line 27** for the number of images you want to scrape
6. Run the code
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage:
```python
#Import libraries (Import in other website scrapers in the future)
from GoogleImageScrapper import GoogleImageScraper
from GettyImagesScrapper import GettyImageScraper
import os
from patch import webdriver_executable

#Define file path (Don't change)
webdriver_path = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'webdriver', webdriver_executable()))
image_path = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'photos'))

#Website used for scraping: 
website_list = ['google', 'getty', 'shutterstock', 'bing']
search_site = website_list[1] #change index number here to select the website you are using

#Add new search key into array ["cat","t-shirt","apple","orange","pear","fish"]
search_keys= ["cat","t-shirt"]

#Parameters
number_of_images = 10
headless = True
min_resolution=(0,0)
max_resolution=(1920,1080)

#Main program
#Choose if using Google or Getty Images Scrapper (or add in other options next time)
for search_key in search_keys:
    if search_site == 'google':
        image_scrapper = GoogleImageScraper(webdriver_path,image_path,search_key,number_of_images,headless,min_resolution,max_resolution)
    if search_site == 'getty':
        image_scrapper = GettyImageScraper(webdriver_path,image_path,search_key,number_of_images,headless,min_resolution,max_resolution)
    if search_site == 'shutterstock':
        image_scrapper = ShutterstockImageScraper(webdriver_path,image_path,search_key,number_of_images,headless,min_resolution,max_resolution)
    if search_site == 'bing':
        image_scrapper = BingImageScraper(webdriver_path,image_path,search_key,number_of_images,headless,min_resolution,max_resolution)
    image_urls = image_scrapper.find_image_urls()
    image_scrapper.save_images(image_urls)

#Release resources    
del image_scrapper

```  
## Development Roadmap:  
[x] Add Scraping from Getty Images  
[ ] Add scraping for shutterstock and bing (**_In-Progress_**)  
[ ] Streamline all website scrapers into one script (Code Refactoring)  
[ ] Support for other website browsers (Firefox, Edge)  
[ ] Add in support for multiple image formats (e.g: jpg, png, jpeg) and reformat non-conventional image formats (webp, etc...)
